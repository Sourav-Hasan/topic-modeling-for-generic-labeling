I love to go to school. When I have a holiday I miss school. I go to school with my friends, and we enjoy biking down together. My school is two kilometers away from home. I wake up early in the morning to go to school as classes begin at quarter past seven every day.I find my school uniform very smart.There was a fixed dress for students. The teachers are strict about our dress being spotlessly clean.At the assembly the students, all together, look very  well turned out.At school I learn many new things each day. There are many subjects that are taught to us like languages, mathematics, science and social studies.We also have interesting co-curricular works that help ourselves learn better. We also go on educative excursions.There are a number of extra-curricular activities also that are offered to us. We are afforded opportunities to participate in various sports, music, dance, theatre and art events. These are fun activities that also help us develop our hobbies.
