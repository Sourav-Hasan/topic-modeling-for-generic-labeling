We had one argument, and that is all. Cigarettes. Me telling you they stink, saying, please brush your teeth so I can kiss you.Making you change your shirt. Me saying, isn’t your life worth something to you?You, relaxed, kind, unmoved, infuriating. Me asking, do you not care about your life? You saying, sure, yes, that’s why I want to enjoy it, and I enjoy smoking. Come here. I love you.So I left.A year later, I married him, a nonsmoker who ate only organic. A year after that, you showed up to his funeral and hugged me tight.
